You can change the order of tools and adjust it for yourself in the application settings.

Also on this panel is a button that opens the project settings. She looks like a gear. In the project settings, you can change such project properties as:
     * Name
     * Background color
     * Project dimensions
In addition to this, you can also rotate or mirror the project.\n
